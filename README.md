# CI-CD-Pipeline-with-Jenkins-Terraform-and-Ansible

## üìù Overview
The project aims to automate the infrastructure provisioning and deployment process using Terraform, Jenkins, and Ansible. It focuses on creating a pipeline to manage the infrastructure as code (IaC), configure application servers, and deploy applications efficiently.

## üöÄ Features
1. **Infrastructure Pipeline with Terraform and Jenkins**
   - Automate the provisioning of cloud resources using Terraform.
   - Integrate Terraform with Jenkins for continuous infrastructure deployment.

2. **Configuration Management with Ansible**
   - Use Ansible to configure application servers.
   - Configure Ansible to run over private IPs through a bastion for secure access.

3. **Jenkins Slave Configuration**
   - Configure EC2 instances  `(private/public)`  as Jenkins slaves to distribute workload.

4. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Create a pipeline in Jenkins to deploy the Node.js application from a specific branch (rds_redis).

5. **Load Balancer Setup**
   - Add an application load balancer to the Terraform code to expose the Node.js application on port 80.

6. **Testing**
   - Test the application by calling specific URLs `loadbalancer_url/db` and `loadbalancer_url/redis` to ensure proper functionality.

## üìÅ Directory Structure
- `Ansible/`
    - **jenkins_master role/:** Ansible role for configuring the Jenkins master node.
    - **jenkins_slave role/:** Ansible role for configuring Jenkins slave nodes.
    - **install_services.yml:** Ansible playbook to install services.
    - **inventory:** Ansible inventory file.
- `Terraform/`
    - Terraform scripts for infrastructure provisioning.
- `Jenkinsfile`
    - Jenkins script for the Terraform pipeline to provision infrastructure.
- `NodejsApp_Jenkinsfile`
    - Jenkins script for the Node.js app pipeline to deploy the app.

## üìã Prerequisites
1. Create S3 bucket and dynamodb table on your aws account.
2. Add your bucket and dynamodb name in `Terraform/backend.tf`
   ```PYTHON
   terraform {
      backend "s3" {
        bucket         = "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"
        key            = "terraform.tfstate"
        region         = "YOUR_REGION_NAME"
        dynamodb_table = "YOUR_TABLE_NAME"
      }
    }
   ```
3. Initialize ansible roles for a Jenkins master and slave in your terminal.
   ```
    ansible-galaxy init jenkins_master
    ansible-galaxy init jenkins_slave
   ```
4. Run your ansible playbooks using the following command:
   ```
   ansible-playbook -i inventory --private-key /PATH_TO_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY.pem install_services.yml
   ```
5. Create 2 ec2 instances **ubuntu**  `master/public_slave` 
- Then configure in jenkins master the another ec2 to be jenkins slave (public)

### 1. Create infrastructure pipeline to run terraform with jenkins task.
- Jenkins script will be found at [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/Nada-Khater/CI-CD-Pipeline-with-Jenkins-Terraform-and-Ansible/blob/main/Jenkinsfile).

### 2. Configure ansible to run over private ips through bastion.
- This Ansible [inventory configuration](https://github.com/Nada-Khater/CI-CD-Pipeline-with-Jenkins-Terraform-and-Ansible/blob/main/Ansible/inventory) sets up SSH tunneling to connect to a host  `(10.0.3.156)`  in a **private network** via a **bastion** host  `(3.254.124.37)` . 
- The  `ansible_ssh_common_args`  variable specifies a ProxyCommand that establishes an SSH connection to the bastion host using a specified private key  `(../ssh-key.pem)` . 
- This configuration enables Ansible to access the target host through the bastion host
  ```
  # app private ip
  [app]
  10.0.3.156  # app private ip
  
  [app:vars]
  ansible_user = ubuntu
  ansible_ssh_private_key_file = ../ssh-key.pem
  ansible_ssh_common_args = "-o ProxyCommand=\"ssh -i ../ssh-key.pem ubuntu@3.254.124.37 -W %h:%p\""    # bastion public ip
  ```
- Run your ansible playbook using:
  ```
  ansible-playbook -i inventory --private-key ../ssh-key.pem install_services.yml
  ```

### 3. Write ansible script to configure ec2 to run as jenkins slaves
- Script will be found at `Ansible/jenkins_slave/tasks/main.yml` [script](https://github.com/Nada-Khater/CI-CD-Pipeline-with-Jenkins-Terraform-and-Ansible/blob/main/Ansible/jenkins_slave/tasks/main.yml)
### 4. Configure slave in jenkins dashboard (with private ip)
- Add node in jenkins master to act as a `private` jenkins slave.

- Allow Jenkins to communicate with the private agent so we open port 50000 in the firewall settings of the private network from  `manage_jenkins/security`  to allow inbound connections from the Jenkins master.

- Then connecting to the application throw bastion and run these commands:
  ```
  curl -sO http://34.251.130.27:8080/jnlpJars/agent.jar

  java -jar agent.jar -url http://34.251.130.27:8080/ -secret d3c287581abad338a03e99a441b57fb7e6237f29206bb0363dd764564a40e114 -name "aws_private_slave" -workDir "/home/ubuntu/jenkins_slave"
  ```
- Agent Connected Successfuly

### 5. Create pipeline to deploy nodejs_example from branch (rds_redis)
- Forked repository with [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/Nada-Khater/jenkins_nodejs_example/blob/rds_redis/Jenkinsfile) in `rds_redis` branch.

### Some credentials needed for the node app
- To get the password of rds database run the following command
  ```
  cat jenkins_slave/workspace/Infrastructure_Pipeline/Terraform/rds_pass.txt
  ```
- To get the hostname of redis cluster run the following command
  ```
  aws elasticache describe-cache-clusters --cache-cluster-id redis-cluster --show-cache-node-info
  ```
- Configure the needed credentials to your nodejs app in jenkins master 
### 6. Add application load balancer to your terraform code to expose your nodejs app on port 80 on the load balancer
- Load balancer code added in `Terraform/load_balancer.tf` [code](https://github.com/Nada-Khater/CI-CD-Pipeline-with-Jenkins-Terraform-and-Ansible/blob/main/Terraform/load_balancer.tf)
### 7. Test your application by calling loadbalancer_url/db and /redis
- In your browser paste the load balancer link and test the app by these links:
- `http://node-alb-536757320.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com/redis`
